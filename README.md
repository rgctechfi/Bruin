## Bruin Pipelines

Bruin is an end-to-end data platform that combines:

- ingestion
- transformation, cleaning, modeling, and aggregation with SQL, Python, and R
- orchestration, scheduling, dependency management, and pipeline run management
- governance through built-in quality checks and validation for accuracy and consistency
- metadata management, including lineage, ownership, and documentation

Bruin lets you keep code logic, configurations, dependencies, and quality checks in one place.
